# Hospital_Management_System_Using_Static
# Hospital Management System Using Static Keyword in Java

This project is a menu-driven Java application developed to demonstrate **proper memory utilization using the `static` keyword** with data members and member functions.  
It is based on a real-world **Hospital Management System** scenario.

## 📚 Project Objective

To show how static variables and static methods help in:
- Saving memory
- Sharing common data among all objects
- Improving performance
- Representing real corporate system design

---

## 🏥 Features

- Add new patient records
- View all patient details
- Search patient by ID
- View hospital information
- Menu-driven program with user input
- Uses static variables for common hospital data

## 🧠 Use of Static Keyword

Static Data Members:
- `hospitalName`
- `emergencyNumber`
- `visitingHours`
- `totalPatients`

These are shared among all patient objects and created only once in memory.

Static Method:
- `showHospitalInfo()`

Used to display common hospital-level information.
